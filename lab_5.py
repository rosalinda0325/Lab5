This program will translate a sentence captures by the user input.
First we read in the text file textese.txt then a list is created 
of strings from each lines in text file.
We will then create a dictionary from the text file
After the text file has been read we will close it

A function to tanslate will be defined which will split user 
input into array of strings. 

A loop will be created using user input for our array, it will find
key words and return back the value in the dictionary

print out the translated sentence to user
